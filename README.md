# sqlalchemy-challenge

I created a "Main" notebook to establish connections, manage SQL data, and create the graphs.  

The "app" notebook handles the presentation of json using flask.  For API Dynamic route, I did not write code for TypeError when the date format was incorrect. I reveiwed the rubric and it did not appear to be part of the assignment requirements.

For the bonus section, I attempted 2 bar chart plots. One uses tmax-tmin to set the peak-to-peak. The other uses standard devation to set the peak-to-peak. I could not match the graph exactly to the example.
